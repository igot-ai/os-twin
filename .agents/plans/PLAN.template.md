<!-- MANAGER INSTRUCTION:
When generating a plan, you MUST explicitly define a `Lifecycle` for EACH Epic.
The roles and lifecycle MUST BE DYNAMICALLY DESIGNED based on the specific requirements of the Epic. 
Not all tasks require an engineer or qa. For example, a research epic might only need a researcher and analyst, while a documentation epic might need a writer and editor.
Whatever the roles, you must design a closed-loop workflow optimized for those specific autonomous agents, allowing them to operate without stalling.
IMPORTANT: Lifecycle state names MUST use the ROLE AGENT NAMES (e.g., `researcher`, `analyst`, `engineer`, `qa`), NOT generic action names (e.g., `research`, `review`, `drafting`). This is because the manager loop uses state names to determine which agent to invoke.
Always map out the transition states, including what happens on failure.

Example of a dynamic closed workflow for a generic task:
```text
pending → [primary-role] → [reviewer-role] ─┬─► passed → signoff
                ▲                           │
                └───── [primary-role] ◄─────┘ (on fail → fixing)
```

Per-epic format:
```
Roles: <role1>, <role2>, ...    (dynamically chosen agents for this epic's workflow)
Objective: <mission>            (what this war-room must achieve — be specific)
Lifecycle:                      (REQUIRED: Dynamically map the closed-loop transitions between the chosen roles, including specific failure/correction states)
Pipeline: <stage1 -> stage2>    (OPTIONAL: only for non-default stage sequences)
Skills: <capabilities>          (comma-separated, guides agent focus)
Working_dir: <path>             (scope agents to a subdirectory)
Capabilities: <cap1, cap2>     (optional: auto-generates review stages)
```

#### War-Room Lifecycle (Closed Loop)

Every war-room runs a dynamically designed closed lifecycle where the specific agents assigned to that epic iterate and correct each other's work until all quality gates pass.

For example, an Engineering Epic might use:

```text
pending → engineer → qa ─┬─► passed → signoff
             ▲            │
             └─ engineer ◄┘ (on fail → fixing)
```

While a Research Epic might use:
```text
pending → researcher → analyst ─┬─► passed → signoff
              ▲                 │
              └── researcher ◄──┘ (on fail → fixing)
```

- Each loop repeats until the review passes or retries are exhausted.
- Complex loops can include escalations (e.g. failing a design review routes back to an architect).

#### Pipeline Directive (Optional)

Override the default lifecycle to add specialized review stages.
Each review stage becomes an additional quality gate with its own correction loop:

```
Pipeline: architect -> engineer -> security-review -> qa
Pipeline: engineer -> schema-review -> qa
Pipeline: researcher -> engineer -> architect-review -> qa
```

Stages containing "review", "qa", "audit", "check", or "verify" get
pass/fail/escalate transitions with correction loops back through fixing.

#### Capabilities Directive

Declare required capabilities. The system auto-inserts review stages:

```
Capabilities: security, database        (adds security-review + schema-review stages)
Capabilities: accessibility, security   (adds a11y-review + security-review stages)
```

Capability-to-stage mapping:
- `security` -> `security-review` (by `security-auditor`)
- `database` -> `schema-review` (by `database-architect`)
- `architecture` -> `architect-review` (by `architect`)
- `infrastructure` -> `infra-review` (by `devops`)
- `accessibility` -> `a11y-review` (by `accessibility-specialist`)
